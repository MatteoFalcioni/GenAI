# GenAI

This is a comprehensive course on Generative AI. There are many sources to this material, and you will find them listed in the notebooks. 

Most of the work just "scratches the surface" of all possible applications. They serve as an introduction for more complex research.

Nonetheless, some chapters are deep and detailed, most of all LangGraph-related stuff. 

This repository is in continous expansion as I learn.
