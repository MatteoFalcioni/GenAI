    "# Recursion Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook let's make some tries defining `remaining_steps` inside a custom `state_schema` and seeing if it works for recursion limit control. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example build a class with `remanining_steps ` and try to make it halt by itself. If it doesn't, it means that LangGraph doesn't handle it automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then after that try and set explicit control flows. I know how to do it in a `Command[Literal[\"next_possible_node1\", \"next_possible_node2\"]]` fashion, but my doubt is: in my supervisor graph I have no nodes. Maybe I should create it from scratch in order to have that kind of control?"

    "> **Why Use `Field()` in Pydantic (and LangGraph)**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When defining default values in a `pydantic.BaseModel`, use `Field()` to avoid bugs — especially with **mutable types** like `dict`, `list`, and `set`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### 🚫 What *not* to do\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> class State(BaseModel):\n",
    ">     loaded: dict = {}  # ❌ Shared across all instances\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### ✅ Correct way\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> from pydantic import Field\n",
    ">\n",
    "> class State(BaseModel):\n",
    ">     loaded: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)  # ✅ New dict per instance\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This ensures that each instance gets its own fresh dictionary and prevents side effects across agents in LangGraph.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### Simple rule of thumb\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Use `Field(default_factory=...)` for mutable types (like `dict`, `list`)\n",
    "> * Use `Field(default=...)` or direct `=` for immutable types (like `int`, `str`)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### In LangGraph\n",
    ">\n",
    "> LangGraph's custom states often contain fields like `messages`, `loaded`, and `remaining_steps`. Use `Field(...)` to ensure proper initialization and avoid shared state bugs between agent runs.\n"
