    "# Recursion Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook let's make some tries defining `remaining_steps` inside a custom `state_schema` and seeing if it works for recursion limit control. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example build a class with `remanining_steps ` and try to make it halt by itself. If it doesn't, it means that LangGraph doesn't handle it automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then after that try and set explicit control flows. I know how to do it in a `Command[Literal[\"next_possible_node1\", \"next_possible_node2\"]]` fashion, but my doubt is: in my supervisor graph I have no nodes. Maybe I should create it from scratch in order to have that kind of control?"
