Subject: Unable to Attend Work Today

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that I'm not feeling well today and, unfortunately, won't be able to make it into the office. 

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure to catch up on any missed work once I'm feeling better. Please let me know if there's anything urgent that needs my attention today.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Matteo
