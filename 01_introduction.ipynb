        "Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that are capable of creating new content, ranging from text and images to music and entire virtual environments. These models learn from vast datasets and leverage complex algorithms, particularly neural networks, to generate outputs that resemble human-created data. Generative AI not only imitates but often enhances creative processes, enabling groundbreaking innovations across industries.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, Generative AI relies heavily on deep learning, particularly architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and more recently, Transformer-based models. These technologies allow machines to not just analyze existing data, but to dream up entirely new possibilities.\n",
