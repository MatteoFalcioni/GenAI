        "OpenAI is a leading artificial intelligence research and deployment company whose mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. It is best known for developing state-of-the-art AI models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for natural language processing, DALL·E for image generation, Whisper for speech recognition, and Codex for code generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI provides access to these models via powerful, developer-friendly APIs that allow users to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications. These APIs support a wide range of use cases, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **Natural Language Understanding and Generation**: chatbots, summarization, translation, question answering\n",
        "*  **Image Generation**: text-to-image generation using models like DALL·E\n",
        "*  **Code Completion and Assistance**: intelligent code generation with Codex\n",
        "*  **Speech-to-Text**: transcription and audio processing with Whisper\n",

        "## 1.1 OpenAI API Access\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers can access these services via the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/), where they can obtain [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), monitor usage, and manage billing. The APIs can be accessed using Python, JavaScript, or any HTTP client. OpenAI also supports **fine-tuning**, **embeddings**, and **function calling**, allowing for highly customized applications."
