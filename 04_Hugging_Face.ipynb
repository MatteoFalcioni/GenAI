        "Hugging Face is one of the most influential companies in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly known for democratizing access to state-of-the-art machine learning models. Originally famous for its work in natural language processing (NLP), Hugging Face created the `transformers` library, which provides easy-to-use implementations of powerful models like BERT, GPT, T5, and many others. Over time, it expanded beyond NLP into areas like computer vision, audio processing, and even reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Hugging Face Hub acts as a central repository where researchers and developers can share, download, and fine-tune pre-trained models and datasets. This ecosystem has become essential for accelerating AI research and application development, reducing the need to train large models from scratch. Today, Hugging Face offers tools for model training, evaluation, deployment, and even optimization, playing a critical role in making cutting-edge AI more accessible to both researchers and industry practitioners."

This allows models to efficiently handle rare words, typos, and unseen vocabulary while preserving semantic meaning.\n",
